        What does it take to motivate real, lasting social change? I believe that in its simplest form it takes people working
        together towards a specific and attainable goal. I created this site so that if you have that idea, big or small,
        you can share it with others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below, are all the movements started by the users of this site represented visually. When you join, every member of the
        site will be able to sed the movements you start. They will be able to join and interact with you. Together it is
        our hope that we can organize and find people inspired enough to effect real, meaningful change.
      </p>

      <p>
        To start, just select an area and give a description. Every user of the site will be able to see your movement on
        the map below. They will be able to join and discuss your idea. You will have access to other like minded individuals,
        and together (or so is my hope) we can begin to change the world one small neighborhood or large city at a time.
